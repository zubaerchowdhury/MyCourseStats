# MyCourseStats

This project is about supporting additional statistical data and metrics on each courses offered by UMiami every semester and their instructors. It will provide course popularity and historically offered data.

**Advantages:**
- Informs how consistently courses are offered in CaneLink (University of Miami's Student Information System), especially courses that are only offered by announcement
- Helps planning out 4-year plan, reducing pressure on advisors
- Gives an estimate of your chance to get enrolled in a course based on your enrollment date
- A course’s enrollment rate correlates to course’s/instructor's popularity
- Dropout rate correlates to how demanding the course is / how good the course is
- Features most benefited by other departments where students can enroll by themselves
- Possibility to scale to other universities across US

**Future Feature:**
- Include all degree program requirements and 4 year course outline for all departments
- AI advisor that can help you plan out your daily schedule, semester schedule and 4 year degree plan (1st year free trial with .edu email, paid feature afterwards)
- (Need to update WebScraper to scrape date from the current updated CaneLink UI)
